    <p>Hello, I am Romain BOBENRIETER, I am 18 years old.</p>

            <h2><ins>Baccalaureate</ins></h2>
            <p>
                I obtained my French General High School Diploma (BAC) in 2023, at <a href="http://lyceedeck.fr">Deck high school</a> in Guebwiller.<br>My two majors were mathematics and computer science.
                <br>

            <h2><ins>Why this way ?</ins></h2>
            <p>
                I chose the general high school diploma because I didn't know what I would do after high school. 
                I chose the way with the more opened doors, indeed the technical and professional ways
                often are for a sector in particular.
            </p>

            <h2><ins>Current formation</ins></h2>
            <p>
                I currently prepare a B-Tech, in the first year, in computer networking technologies (<a href="https://www.iutcolmar.uha.fr/index.php/formations/diplomes/bachelor-universitaire-de-technologie-b-u-t-bac-3/b-u-t-reseaux-et-telecommunications/">BUT RT</a>) at a <a href="https://www.iutcolmar.uha.fr/">technical college (IUT) in Colmar</a>.

        <article>
            <h2><ins>Why this B-Tech ?</ins></h2>
            <p>
                I chose this B-Tech because I have had a passion for IT for several years, so I chose to make it my profession.

            <h2><ins>Feedback about B-Tech</ins></h2>
            <p>
                I am quite satisfied with this formation. I revised some of the concepts I had learnt at high school, as part of the NSI major I mentioned <a href=#>earlier</a>.
                <br>I am also learning a lot of new things.
                <br>I particularly appreciate the atmosphere in my practical work group.
            </p>

            <h2><ins>Project for the future</ins></h2>
            <p>
                As far as my immediate future is concerned, I would like to sign an apprenticeship contract, for the next two years, with a cybersecurity
                company.
                <br>Once I have obtained this diploma, I would like to continue on to a master's degree, also as an apprentice, in order to complete my formation in cybersecurity.
